The aim of this R package is to easy plot the intersections of different gene lists in venn diagrams. It also creates tables for genes in each region together with their annotation. The functions that can be found in the package are:

- **VennPlot.2** : Venn diagrams for two tables of genes.
- **VennPlot.3** : Venn diagrams for three tables of genes.
- **VennPlot.4** : Venn diagrams for four tables of genes.
- **Venn5Plot** : Venn diagrams for five tables of genes.
